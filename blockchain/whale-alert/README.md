# Websocket Whale Tranfers Alerts 

This example will allow you to connect to the Amberdata Blockchain Event websocket feed.  We will consume raw event data from the `DAI` contract address. 
Then we will filter for only `Transfer` events over $1,000,000. 

Additionally, we will check the wallets transfers for ENS domains to contextualize the tranfer.  

When the event is observed, we will then use `Twilio` API to text ourselves when this occurs.
